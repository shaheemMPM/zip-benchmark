# Analyzing Benchmark Results

This guide will help you analyze the results of your zip benchmarking tests.

## Accessing Results

Benchmark results are stored in the `benchmark/results/` directory. Each run creates a new subdirectory with a timestamp.

## Understanding the Results

Each result file contains:

- Implementation details (language, library)
- Input parameters (file count, total size)
- Performance metrics (execution time, memory usage)
- Output details (zip file size, compression ratio)

## Generating Reports

To generate a comparative report:

1. Navigate to the project root.
2. Run the report generation script:
   ```sh
   python benchmark/scripts/generate_report.py
   ```
   This will create a report in `benchmark/results/report.md`.

## Key Metrics to Consider

When analyzing results, pay attention to:

1. Execution time
2. Memory usage
3. Compression ratio
4. CPU utilization
5. Error rates (if any)

## Visualizing Data

Consider using tools like matplotlib or gnuplot to create visual representations of your data. This can help in identifying trends and making comparisons easier.

## Making Conclusions

When drawing conclusions:

- Consider trade-offs between speed, memory usage, and compression ratio.
- Look for consistent patterns across different file sizes and quantities.
- Take into account the specific requirements of your use case.

Remember, the "best" solution may vary depending on your specific needs and constraints.
